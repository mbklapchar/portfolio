            So who am I? <br>
            I am Matthew Klapchar. I am an aspiring web designer from North Carolina. I do my best to be the nicest guy you could meet, and I would apply the same effort to my work.<br>
            My friends have described me as generous, kind, trustworthy, hardworking, dedicated, and in touch with my emotions.<br>
            I pledge to do my best to provide quality work to my clients and be the same friendly and kind person I always have been.
